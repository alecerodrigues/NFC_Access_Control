# NFC_Scan_Auth
This program builds on my previous authorizer to power two small 5V solenoids. My idea behind this is to create a small locking box with a battery to power the components when in use.
##### Parts List
- MFRC522: An integrated reader/writer IC for contactless communcication.
  - Operaterating frequency: 13.56 MHZ
  - Reading Capailities: NFC or RFID

##### Putting it all together...
The MFRC522 must be connected to the Nano is a specific way to function. Certain parameters can be changed within the program itself but for my purposes, I have listed the connecting pins below.
| MFRC522 | Arduino Nano |
| --- | --- |
| SDA | D10 |
| SCK | D13 |
| MOSI | D11 |
| MISO | D12 |
| IRQ | D9 |
| GND | GND |
| RST | (NONE) |
| 3.3V | 3V3 |
