# NFC_Scan_Auth
This program is designed to be a simple authorizer that also outputs a scanned cards UID to the monitor. Line 44 can be changed to any UID(s) that match a scannable to allow authorization. This program can be expanded upon for other implemenations and I utilize it as a shell for future programs.
